# Advent Of Code 2021
My solutions for the [Advent of Code - 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

For each new Day...
- [ ] Create a DayNN directory
- [ ] Create a 1.js for the first challenge
- [ ] Create an input.txt file with the input for the challenge; optionally create a test-input.js with the sample input, for easier testing
- [ ] Since the second challenge builds on the first, copy the completed 1.js to 2.js, and modify for the second
- [ ] Copy the source of the final HTML page after solving both challenges, and paste into [CodeBeautify](https://codebeautify.org/html-to-markdown) to get a markdown version of the page
- [ ] Add a README each day, with the markdown from CodeBeautify
- [ ] Commit the day's solution
